## üó£Ô∏èPreface
This repo is a **`modified version`** of [cs2-WeaponPaints-website](https://github.com/L1teD/cs2-WeaponPaints-website), which has localized skin images(Chinese Language Only) and complete Chinese translation, as well as added support for **`glove change`**, and optimized the original request part [Prevent an abundance of redundant requests about JSON files.](https://github.com/L1teD/cs2-WeaponPaints-website/pull/12), the original project will make dozens of requests for JSON files of skin weapons.


#### modified list:
- Localized skin, agent images (Chinese Language Only, You shouldn't need this if you are not in China.)
- Support **`glove change`**
- Support **`music kit change`**
- optimized the original request part

Btw, the original project got a private plan, You guys can donate to the original author to get the private plan. The private plan has more features like `gloves change`, `workshop`(Idk what's this, It seems like a backend that can be used to manage the user's skins, but I'm not sure about this.).

**This repo is a modified version. If you need the private plan, Please go to the original author's repository.**

## üìùBefore Start
**You can step out of this section if you are not in China or you don't wanna localize the images.**
- You need download this repo [counter-strike-image-tracker](https://github.com/ByMykel/counter-strike-image-tracker/)
- extract `static/panorama/images` to `src/public/images` folder.
- Replace all url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ByMykel/counter-strike-image-tracker/main/static/panorama/images` to `/images` in `src/public/js/json/skins/{lang}-skins.json` and `src/public/js/json/skins/{lang}-agents.json`.  

The images folder size will be around `1.16GB`.
The reason for localizing the images is nothing else, because Github loads slowly in China, so I chose to localize them, you don't need this step if you are not in China.
